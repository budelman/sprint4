Sprint 3: Holla for a $

Load in the jQuery library and "refactor" (i.e. reorganize & simplify) your code from Sprint 2 to incorporate space-saving selection, event attachment and utility functions from jQuery. Again, your tool should function exactly as before.

Note: After you see how easy Ajax is with jQuery, you will DESPISE us for making you build it first in raw JS. You'll get over it.
Keep an eye out for where you can use:

    Element selectors
    Event handlers
    $.getJSON
    $.each (see the jQuery documentation for guidance: http://api.jquery.com)
    $.map (see the jQuery documentation for guidance: http://api.jquery.com)
