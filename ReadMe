Sprint 4: Plug it in, plug it in
Your search tool is getting pretty sweet. Instead of keeping it all to yourself, why don't you turn 
it into a shareable plugin?

Required functionality:

Plugin must accept any path to an external JSON file (assume proper file formatting) as an option
Plugin must accept a string identifying the desired output element as an option; e.g. if you want 
to output to a div with ID "output", you should be able to set the output option to "#output" and 
have it work properly
